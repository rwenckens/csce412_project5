                    <h3>Technical skills</h3>
                    <p>Getting a Computer Science degree is no easy feat, and one begins to amass several relevant technical skills carving a path to enlightenment. During my time spent at A&M, I have gained technical proficiency in C++, my all-time favorite language. C++ wasn’t the beginning of my journey, and it won’t be the end. My first experience with college-level programming was in Python, a language I enjoyed because of its readability and simple syntax. Python helped me formulate my thoughts into seemingly magical sequences of characters as I went through the baby phase of Computer Science. After Python, I was introduced to C++ in a class called Program Design and Concepts. This class was a deep dive into the language and introduced me to important topics including object-oriented programming, pointers, and memory management. Continuing the journey, I took Data Structures and Algorithms while exploring Java and Scheme in a class called Programming Languages. Currently, I am learning about the foundations of software engineering, exploring languages and technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, AWS, and learning about software development methodologies.  Alongside the software engineering class, I am learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming#:~:text=Systems%20programming%20requires%20a%20great,savings%20of%20time%20or%20money.">systems programming</a>, an interesting class covering portions of the operating system.</p>

                    <h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
                    <p>After completion of my Computer Science degree, I am interested in a full-time role in either full-stack or back-end software engineering. Currently, I am pursuing a minor in both <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/arts-and-sciences/mathematics/minor/">Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/cybersecurity-minor/#programrequirementstext">Cybersecurity</a>. I believe that a minor in Cybersecurity will go hand in hand with a job in software engineering, whether full stack or back end. Mathematics is a large part of Computer Science; it helps to analytically think through complex decisions. </p>

                    <p>I was born and raised in Houston, Texas and have always had an interest in technology. The choice of Texas A&M for Computer Science was easy because of the proximity to my hometown and excellent program <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/about/facts.html#:~:text=Our%20undergraduate%20program%20in%20computer,Download%20our%20latest%20fact%20sheet.&text=Ranked%20among%20public%20institutions%2C%202024.">rankings</a>. When I’m not studying or working on projects, I like to be outside golfing or bass fishing. </p>
