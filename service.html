                <h2>The <strong>BIG</strong> Event</h2>
                <p>The <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">big event</a> at Texas A&M University is the largest one-day, student-run service project in the country. This initiative sees approximately 15,000 Aggies working across 2,000 job sites within the Bryan-College Station community as a means of expressing gratitude to the local populace. Last year, I attended the Big Event and helped a community member with a backyard project.</p>

                <h2>Tutoring</h2>
                <p>I believe that teaching a topic to peers shows a true grasp of understanding. Leading a weekly study group for Calculus I and II, I discovered that tutoring and teaching your peers helps solidify your own grasp of the material. Similarly, my two roommates are enrolled in <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/course-descriptions/csce/">CSCE 121- Program Design and Concepts</a>, a foundational C++ course. I enjoy talking them through the intricacies of C++ while appreciating the collaborative nature of learning. </p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.bbbsbrazos.org/">Big Brothers Big Sister of the Brazos Valley</a> is an organization that I am planning to volunteer for in the future. Myself and the organization believe that every child is inherently capable of success and deserving of opportunity. </p>
